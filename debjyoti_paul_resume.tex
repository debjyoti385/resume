It is purely based on the data collected from Twitter.  Read our Compass paper for details.\\[0.1cm]
        Event Aggregator & \hspace{0.5cm}  This project finds events from news articles, categorize them and gathers all articles talking about same event to a set. Each set of articles is referred as Event Entity. Information extraction process is applied to extract more information related to it. The code can process large scale data. The code will be made public later. \\[0.1cm]

Data warehousing and cubing to enable interactive visualization framework, which helped in determining pattern of Pollution and its reason. \\
        \href{https://goo.gl/wMOl4C}{Dartnews} \href{https://goo.gl/wMOl4C}{\textit{goo.gl/wMOl4C}}  & \hspace{0.5cm} A street news browsing application, with an interactive GIS interface. News is organized by locality and topic. The user can explore based on topics (eg crime, politics etc) and geolocation. We used Context Dependent Geoparsing, where we attempt to find out which location is relevant to the News. Across all the topics, we saw at least 87\% accuracy of topic prediction, and at least 80\% accuracy of location prediction.\\[0.1cm]

The idea is to tag all geo-location enabled tweets(available publicly) with semantic categories (say sports, politics etc.) and their sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) using text mining. To enable serving of Ads, they also need to be tagged using same categories based on their content. \\
%       \href{http://metonym.in}{Metonym (metonym.in)} & \hspace{1cm}  A synonym based vocabulary learner website built with d3.js, php and dropwizard framework at the backend. For demo use username: "demo" \& password: "12345678"  \\
%Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol    & We here proposed an efficient Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman two-party key agreement protocol using public key authentication based on Elliptic Curve Group. We presented an improved version of that protocol which uses Converse of Fermat’s theorem with eliminated charmichael numbers. Also efficiently generating primitive roots for D-H key.\\
%Real time discrimination of Speech and Music & Real-time speaker segmentation is required in many applications, such as speaker tracking in real- time news-video segmentation and classification, or real-time speaker adapted speech. After feature extraction, using Low Short Term Energy Ratio (LSTER) the input digital audio stream is classified into speech and music. Here we have used DSK6713 Digital Signal Processing Kit.\\
