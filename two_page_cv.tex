    \href{http://github.com/debjyoti385/intelliad}{Intelliad} &  A Social Media driven Intelligent Ad-Targeting framework using Geo-profiling. The idea is to tag all geo-location enabled tweets(available publicly) with semantic categories (say sports, politics etc.) and their sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) using text mining. To enable serving of Ads, they also need to be tagged using same categories based on their content. In the end, for every geolocation-enabled ad request, tags of data points in vicinity (the neighbourhood being controlled online) will be used to generate a runtime profile for the request, and appropriate ads will be picked for serving.  \\

       \href{http://github.com/debjyoti385/dartnews}{Dartnews}   & A street news browsing application, with an interactive GIS interface. News is organized by locality and topic. The user can choose one or more topics of interest (eg crime, politics etc), and also narrow down to the locality of interest. This was done using a technique that we call Context Dependent Geoparsing, where we attempt to find out which location is relevant to the News. Across all the topics, we saw at least 87\% accuracy of topic prediction, and at least 80\% accuracy of location prediction.\\
       \\
%   RCached tree & The objective is to speed up performance of point, range and kNN search queries for frequent or popular queries in databases. We came up with a variant of the R-Tree indexing structure with some features like caching at each node for popular queries.\\

%Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol    & We here proposed an efficient Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman two-party key agreement protocol using public key authentication based on Elliptic Curve Group. We presented an improved version of that protocol which uses Converse of Fermat’s theorem with eliminated charmichael numbers. Also efficiently generating primitive roots for D-H key.\\
       \\
Real time discrimination of Speech and Music & Real-time speaker segmentation is required in many applications, such as speaker tracking in real- time news-video segmentation and classification, or real-time speaker adapted speech. After feature extraction, using Low Short Term Energy Ratio (LSTER) the input digital audio stream is classified into speech and music. Here we have used DSK6713 Digital Signal Processing Kit.\\
