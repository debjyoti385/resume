        \href{http://estorm.org}{Twitter Election 2016 Sentiment Analysis} & \hspace{0.5cm} This project explores how Twitter can be used to analyze the popularity of Political Parties for the Presidential Election 2016. It is purely based on the data collected from Twitter. We provide unbiased analysis of popularity based on the sentiment analysis for each party (Republican and Democratic) at basic geospatial unit area which is `county' (not Electoral Vote region) is our case. We also present time-range analysis of the data. Also a Bursty Event Detection System is used to detect when surge of tweets happened. Our Bursty Event detection correctly identified the tweet bursts and associated with the event happened at that time. \\
        \\
         Event Aggregator & \hspace{0.5cm}  This project finds events from news articles, categorize them and gathers all articles talking about same event to a set. Each set of articles is referredas Event Entity. Information extraction process is applied to extract more information related to it. The code can process large scale data. The code will be made public after the paper is published.  \\
        \\
        \href{https://musicatlas.github.io/}{MusicAtlas} & \hspace{0.5cm}  This website is designed for music lovers to learn about music based on countries. This is a unique tool to explore and analyze the trend of music based on time frame, genre and artists. Almost all data from 19th century to till date. Please make sure you allow SSL connection from api server via this \href{https://db03.cs.utah.edu:8181/api/country_track}{link} before accessing \href{https://musicatlas.github.io/musicatlas/}{@musicatlas}.\\[0.5cm]
        \\
         \href{https://bitbucket.org/debjyotipaul385/quakeanalysis/wiki/Home}{QuakeAnalysis} & \hspace{0.5cm}  This project is based on the seismic activity across world which widely varies in characteristic and patterns. We have found some distinguish patterns among the seismic activities and present them in an insightful manner. Check wiki of \href{https://bitbucket.org/debjyotipaul385/quakeanalysis/wiki/Exploration}{Exploration} and \href{https://bitbucket.org/debjyotipaul385/quakeanalysis/wiki/Analysis}{Analysis}\\

        \href{https://github.com/debjyoti385/QuestionAnswerNLP}{QuestionAnswering} & \hspace{0.5cm}  Closed domain Question Answer System. The system has \emph{Recall} of  63\% and \emph{F-score} of 43\%.   \\
       \\
        \href{http://debjyoti385.github.io/AirQuality/}{AirQuality @Utah } & \hspace{0.5cm} Goldman Sachs Hackathon Runners-Up. Explored and analyzed air quality of Utah from given dataset. Applied data warehousing strategies and built a cubing server to serve the front end. Frontend includes interactive visualization framework to analyze Air Quality / Pollution in Utah region.  \\
       \\
    \href{http://metonym.in}{Metonym (metonym.in)} & \hspace{0.5cm} A synonym based vocabulary learner website built with d3.js, php and dropwizard framework at the backend. For demo use username: "demo" \& password: "12345678"  \\
       \\
    \href{http://github.com/debjyoti385/intelliad}{Intelliad} & \hspace{0.5cm}  A Social Media driven Intelligent Ad-Targeting framework using Geo-profiling. The idea is to tag all geo-location enabled tweets(available publicly) with semantic categories (say sports, politics etc.) and their sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) using text mining. To enable serving of Ads, they also need to be tagged using same categories based on their content. In the end, for every geolocation-enabled ad request, tags of data points in vicinity (the neighbourhood being controlled online) will be used to generate a runtime profile for the request, and appropriate ads will be picked for serving.  \\

\section{Projects (continued)}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}p{\textwidth-\rcollength-130pt}p{\rcollength+130pt}}
       \href{http://github.com/debjyoti385/dartnews}{Dartnews}   & \hspace{0.5cm} A street news browsing application, with an interactive GIS interface. News is organized by locality and topic. The user can choose one or more topics of interest (eg crime, politics etc), and also narrow down to the locality of interest. This was done using a technique that we call Context Dependent Geoparsing, where we attempt to find out which location is relevant to the News. Across all the topics, we saw at least 87\% accuracy of topic prediction, and at least 80\% accuracy of location prediction.\\
        RCached tree & \hspace{0.5cm} The objective is to speed up performance of point, range and kNN search queries for frequent or popular queries in databases. We came up with a variant of the R-Tree indexing structure with some features like caching at each node for popular queries.\\
    \\
       Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol    & \hspace{0.5cm} We here proposed an efficient Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman two-party key agreement protocol using public key authentication based on Elliptic Curve Group. We presented an improved version of that protocol which uses Converse of Fermat’s theorem with eliminated charmichael numbers. Also efficiently generating primitive roots for D-H key.\\
       \\
Real time discrimination of Speech and Music & Real-time speaker segmentation is required in many applications, such as speaker tracking in real- time news-video segmentation and classification, or real-time speaker adapted speech. After feature extraction, using Low Short Term Energy Ratio (LSTER) the input digital audio stream is classified into speech and music. Here we have used DSK6713 Digital Signal Processing Kit.\\
